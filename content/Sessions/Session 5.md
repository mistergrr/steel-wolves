# Day 5
[[Grrurika]] and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] have rescued a dwarf from [[Plaguechanged]] gnolls. The ruby rewarded to [[Grrurika]] has a magical aura. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] heals both of them back to full.

[[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] prays to [[Bahamut]], who reveals the path the gnolls took. It leads through [[Helm's Hold#Scar Alley|Scar Alley]] to [[Helm's Hold#The Warrens]]. 

> MISSED: As they get closer to [[Helm's Hold#The Warrens]], the [[Symphony of Madness]] get louder in [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter's]] head — DC 13 WIS (Perception) check for [[Grrurika]] to hear it, too.

They spot a couple of [[Plaguechanged]] gnolls guarding an entrance. They debate what to do as neither are armoured. The gnolls have glowing blue eyes, meaning they can't stay hidden for long. One gnoll has a whip, while the other seems to be in pain. They decide to fight.

**Combat**
[[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] step out from the alley and casts "Sacred Flame," on the fire burst gnoll. It yelps and throws a spear at him before running up. The spear misses. The other gnoll also runs up and tries to whip [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]], missing. Grrurika then steps by [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] and smashes the first gnoll square in the chest. This triggers it to explode. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] and the remaining gnoll succeed on their DEX saves, reducing the damage, while [[Grrurika]] rolls a nat20 and avoids damage altogether.

The surviving gnoll calls out for more help and misses an attack on [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] again. [[Grrurika]] manoeuvres behind the gnoll and hits it in the back. She doesn't see a backup gnoll emerge from the hole and run up to her. It flame whips her in the back. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] kills the scouring lash gnoll.

[[Grrurika]] spins around to hit the gnoll that attacked her. She sees it's a scouring devourer of flame gnoll. The gnoll is holding a flaming whip and a lit torch. The gnoll sticks its torch into itself, burning and healing at the same time. Its flame whip also charges up with more energy and it whips [[Grrurika]] hard.

[[Grrurika]] grapples the gnoll and spots a drainpipe emptying into a barrel behind the gnoll. She tells [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] to use the barrel to douse the gnoll. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] casts "Resistance" on [[Grrurika]] and runs for the barrel. The gnoll manages to lash [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] as he runs past. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] reaches the barrel and kicks it over, dousing the scouring flame devourer gnoll. [[Grrurika]] hits the gnoll once and sees it's trying to escape back into [[Helm's Hold#The Warrens|The Warrens]]. She surges and hits it again, this time in the back, killing it.
**Combat End**

[[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] doesn't think it's a good idea to head deeper into [[Helm's Hold#The Warrens|The Warrens]] and suggests going back to the [[Old Dirty Dwarf]]. He also notices tomorrow will be a full moon. "I hope [[Satarin|Satarin's]] treatment sorts you out soon, or tomorrow will be unpleasant."

They toss the gnoll's bodies into the hole and head to the tav, where [[Grrurika]] sings "Ben" to her bowl of cheesy food before they turn in for the night.

# Day 6 — The Full Moon
At the [[Cathedral of Helm]], [[Grrurika]] treats herself to cheese snacks as she receives her treatment. She feels a lot better after this session, the treatment warming her up and removing any aches.

Afterwards, she invites [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] to boardgames in the breakroom. Fuzzles turns out to be adept at pictionary. They also invite a few other patients to join. [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] thinks it's a good idea as it allows him to keep an eye on [[Grrurika]] as the full moon arrives. The light of the moon spills into the breakroom, bathing [[Grrurika]] in its glow. She doesn't shapeshift, signalling that her treatment has worked. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief until the sounds of howling in the distance sends shivers down everyone's spines.

A banging is heard from the secured wards. Wardens run past the breakroom, preparing for what might emerge from within. [[Grrurika]] and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] rush to grab their weapons so they can help. They don't have enough time to don armour, so they'll have to go without.

They hear the sound of a heavy door breaking and the sound of fighting coming from the corridor. Claws skitter on stone ground as an injured werewolf appears in the doorway. It looks rabid and its eyes dart around, looking for an exit.

**Combat**
[[Grrurika]] rushes to block the door. The werewolf tries to push her out of the way but she stands firm. She smashes her morningstar into it, but it doesn't do any damage. She switches to [[Wolfsbane]]. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] tries casting "Hold Person," but the wolf shrugs off its effects. 

[[Grrurika]] slashes at the wolf with [[Wolfsbane]]. The wolf howls and tries to bite and claw her. She manages to block the bite with her shield, but doesn't see the claw coming and it clashes her. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] doesn't have any silvered weapons, so he casts "Guiding Bolt" into the wolf's back.

[[Grrurika]] slashes the werewolf once more and uses her pommel to knock it out.
**Combat end**

Wardens emerge into the room and thank her profusely before taking the werewolf to a more secure room. Many of the wardens were injured in the fight, so [[Grrurika]] and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] help the nurses provide aid.

[[Grrurika]] is thanked as an eternal friend of the [[Cathedral of Helm]]. She and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] are given beds for the night as it's too dangerous to go out into the Hold tonight.

# Day 7
In the morning, [[Grrurika]] collects her things and says goodbye to her new friends. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] still has to complete his treatment. He tells [[Grrurika]] to look out for him if she's ever at [[The Chasm]]. Fuzzles waves her goodbye.

Before leaving [[Helm's Hold]], [[Grrurika]] stops by a magic shop to enquire about her ruby. The shopkeeper tells her that it will imbue power into her equipment if she can find an arcane blacksmith to embed it for her. She also appraises the ruby for 800gp.

[[Grrurika]] buys some blade oils — goblinoids and beasts before taking a coach back to [[Neverwinter]]


# Summary
[[Grrurika]] and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] track the source of the gnolls to [[Helm's Hold#The Warrens]]. They don't enter as it would be too big of a job for the both of them. [[Grrurika]] completes her treatment of lycanthropy. They stop a werewolf from escaping the [[Cathedral of Helm]] into [[Helm's Hold]]. [[Grrurika]] says farewell and returns to [[Neverwinter]].
