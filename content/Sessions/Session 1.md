# An Unusual Mission
[[Captain Thorne Blackwood]] calls Private [[Grrurika]] in for an unusual mission: clearing a cave in a nearby village. The Steel Wolves normally wouldn't do this kind of job, but [[Dagult Neverember]] is trying to gain popularity, and a key Neverwintan â€” [[Greg Fallowfield]] grew up in the village. Resolving the situation will help Dagult gain his support, and the Steel Wolves will be rewarded well for their help.

Her mission is to head to the village of [[Whitepetal Hollow]] to investigate.

**Take either [[Perts Dangling]], [[Schuul Snobb]] or [[Eihr Zissyu]] as a sidekick**.
