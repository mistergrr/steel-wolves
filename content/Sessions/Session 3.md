## Day 3
After bringing the bandit captain back, [[Grrurika]] is sent to [[Blacklake District]] again. She brings [[Schuul Snobb]] as a sidekick. They're at the lake when they see a couple of orcs returning from a raid. [[Grrurika]] calls out for the to "halt."

**Combat**
[[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] runs through the muck and hits with his multi-attack. [[Grrurika]] hits the same orc with a throwing axe then runs in. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] finishes them off. The second orc calls for backup and two more orcs appear at the edge of the lake.

[[Grrurika]] gets a crit on Orc 2. Orc 3 hits [[Grrurika]] from far with a javelin. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] and [[Grrurika]] work the first orc down and [[Grrurika]] kills them with a critical strike.

The two new orcs rush into the muck and get hits in on [[Grrurika]] and [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] each. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] takes a second wind to heal a bit. Together, they kill an orc ([[Grrurika]] kills it with a mace to the face). The last orc hits [[Grrurika]] hard, so [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] taunts it to draw fire. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] kills the last orc with a well placed stab to the throat.

They loot the orcs and find a bag of two elf heads. They also find coins and jewellery. [[Grrurika]] struggles to find her thrown hand axe in the filthy lake and goes up to her neck in the muck.

She looks for the scene of the elf murders to return the heads to the bodies. Starts with [[Babbelbell]], but he doesn't know anything. She gives him food, anyway. **+1 beggars** #rep

They eventually find the scene, where a crowd has gathered. They pass the heads and jewellery to the people there.  **+1 Neverwinter** #rep

They also find the home that were broken into and distribute the money found **+1 Neverwinter** #rep

On the way back home, they hear a commotion and rush to investigate. They come across a rat-man attacking nobles and their guard. 

**Combat**
The guard is killed before they reach. Both [[Grrurika]] and [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] get hits in, but no damage is done. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] realises they're fighting a Wererat. [[Grrurika]] switches to [[Wolfsbane]]. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] doesn't have a suitable weapon, so he makes sure the nobles are okay.

[[Grrurika]] gets bitten and is infected by wererat lycanthropy. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] returns and grapples the wererat with a full nelson. [[Grrurika]] gets it low on health. It breaks free and polymorphs into a giant rat. [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] tries to stop it, but it manages to scurry away.

The nobles come out and reveal themselves to be [[Dagult Neverember]] and [[Lord Aldo Rockflower]]. **+3 Neverwinter** #rep

They escort them back to the [[Hall of Justice]]. [[Dagult Neverember|Neverember]] spends the time getting to know them personally. He gives them a pouch of 300gp as thanks for the rescue.

Back at [[Steel Wolves' HQ]], they report to [[Captain Thorne Blackwood|Captain Thorne]]. He notes worries about orcs breaking through to this side of the city and also of the [[Dead Rats]] still being around. [[Grrurika]] is paid for the orc tusks as well as a 100sp bonus. She splits everything with [[Schuul Snobb|Schuul]] **+1 companion** #rep

[[Captain Thorne Blackwood|Captain Thorne]] tells [[Grrurika]] that she can either pay for a magic service or head to [[Helm's Hold]] to cure her lycanthropy. She chooses to head to [[Helm's Hold]] and is granted a leave of absence.

Day ends with a long shower, although some of the lake smell remains.
