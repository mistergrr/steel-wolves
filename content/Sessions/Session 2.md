- Climbed vines to the roof to get a better look. [[Perts Dangling|Perts]] tried to climb but was too heavy and fell.
- Peered through the damaged ceiling and saw 4 bandits, all with weapons ready and aimed at the front door. Climbed back down to tell [[Perts Dangling|Perts]]. Ordered [[Perts Dangling|Perts]] to go round the other side and try to convince them to open the door.

Post Combat
