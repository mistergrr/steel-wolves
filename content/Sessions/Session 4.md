# Day 4
[[Grrurika]] has troubled sleep — a high fever. She wakes up and prepares to travel to [[Helm's Hold]]. [[Captain Thorne Blackwood]] says he can't spare any soldiers to accompany her and that she'll be fine travelling on her own. She's granted medical leave and given rations for her journey.

Before leaving [[Neverwinter]], she stops by a magic shop. It's run by a wizard named [[Murlyn]]. He doesn't have a cure for lycanthropy, but he sells her some soothing tea to ease the fever and aches.

She takes a coach to [[Helm's Hold]]. It's an open wagon filled with the sick. At the hold, there's a security and customs checkpoint. Since she's a Mintarn soldier with ID, she enters for free and can hold on to her gear.

She finds her way to the [[Cathedral of Helm]] and is pointed toward [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]]. They hit it off and call each other, "Cuz." [[Satarin]]'s mind often wanders as he goes of on tangents. He's initially worried she has werewolf lycanthropy, but sees that she doesn't have any chunks or limbs missing. Wererat lycanthropy isn't as common in the Hold, so he has to take time to prepare a treatment. He's also not as used to administering this treatment, so it may take a few days. She'll be monitored until the full moon in 3 days to be sure she's cured.

She waits in the wards. It's filled with cots of people recovering from various ailments and injuries. Some patients are strapped down. Some seem catatonic. Many have serious injuries that she reckons come from werewolf attacks. She's told her silver sword is a good idea to keep around.

The man in the cot next to hers introduces himself as [[Deuteronomy Albrek]]. He mentions he's spellscarred from fighting in [[The Chasm]] in [[Neverwinter]]. This turns out to be a connection point between them as they're both passionate about clearing the area from aberrations and protecting the city.

[[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] has a pet spider — "Fuzzles" — that he keeps in his pocket. He says he's a servant of [[Bahamut]] and invites her to check out the shrines upstairs. [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] informs her there's a small shrine dedicated to a Dwarf god, [[Marthammor Duin]].

She finds [[Marthammor Duin]]'s shrine. It's dusty and in a dark unused corner. Another dwarf, "Cuz," is there visiting the shrine. He tells her a little about [[Marthammor Duin]].

She sits and talks to the statue, but doesn't have any divine experience. Decides to leave.
> Sarah doesn't seem to be sure on what to do with the deities. She isn't taking to the whole "finding religion thing"
Downstairs, her treatment is ready. It's an IV drip that's cooling and eases the feeling of infection. It takes about an hour or so, and she naps. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] wakes her up. It's night. "You wanna get out of here?"

He leads her to [[Heartward]]. The market is empty of people, but filled with ghosts. He explains that it's a nightly occurrence and that there's no one alive who was around when it began. No one is sure of what's going on, it just seems to be a quirk about the Hold. The ghost hanging in the centre changes every night.

They enter The [[Old Dirty Dwarf]], which is filled with real people who are alive. [[Grrurika]] is drawn in by the smell of cheese. She looks through the food menu, but doesn't notice anything with cheese in it. She asks [[Juetta]] about this and it told the only cheese around is in the mouse traps in the kitchen. She realizes it's the wererat effects and requests cheese on her meal.

After her meal and a few drinks, she gets up to sing karaoke. Rolls a nat20 on performance. The inn goes wild. New customers have been drawn in by the song. [[Juetta]] gives her a free room for the night and another round of drinks on the house. She tries to sing more songs, but "Thriller" doesn't go so well in a town that has been experiencing werewolf attacks. She heads to bed. #rest

# Day 5
[[Grrurika]] wakes up and finds [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] and fuzzles downstairs at the bar. Outside, the sun is too bright and she feels a sensitivity towards it. They make their way back to the [[Cathedral of Helm]]. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] heads down, but [[Grrurika]] decides to explore one of the towers.

It's very high at the top, and the sun and winds are strong here, but it does give her a good view of the Hold. She sees the [[Watcher's Wood]] outside to the east; the slums to the northwest; [[Heartward]].

She heads back down and finds herself in the middle of a church service. A priestess is finishing a sermon and a line of people are lined up to meet with her. [[Grrurika]] decides to go down to see [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]].

She shares her new symptoms with [[Satarin]] and he expresses concerns and fascination. The sunlight sensitivity is common with lycanthropy, so he decides to increase the strength of the treatment. He has to take more time to concoct the new medicine, so [[Grrurika]] offers to get a cheese lunch for them from the markets. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] follows her shopping.

In [[Heartward]], she buys 3 sacks of cheese, some bread, and a jar of honey. They bring it back to the [[Cathedral of Helm]] and join [[Satarin]] in the break room for a hearty lunch. Her leftover cheese is stored in a cold cabinet in the kitchen.

## Treatment Round 2
She's woken up in the evening again by [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuteronomy]] and they head out into town. She carries her weapons this time, but leaves her armour. As they're reaching [[Heartward]], they hear a cry for help from a nearby alley. Both of them rush to the sound and find a spellscarred dawrf fending off two gnolls.

**Combat**
The gnolls are [[Plaguechanged]]. They glow blue from scars. One of them flies at [[Grrurika]] and [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] with wings of blue fire. [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] managing to slash at it in the air with his dagger. The two of them injure the gnoll severely. It starts to glow then explodes in a burst of blue fire. Both [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] and [[Grrurika]] are injured by the blast and are thrown 10ft in opposite directions.

The other gnoll comes at them. It's closer to [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] and fights him. After it gets hit a few times, it also erupts in a blue fire burst. This time, [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] is ready for it and managed to minimize the damage, but is still hurt by it.

With the threat eliminated, [[Deuteronomy Albrek|Deuter]] heals them and explains the mechanics of the [[Plaguechanged]]. He says it's common in [[The Chasm]].

The dwarf that they saved says he doesn't have money, but hands [[Grrurika]] an **Enchanted ruby +1** as thanks.
