The region's hard years have closed many businesses, but the Old Dirty Dwarf has stood the test of time.

The best inn and tavern in [[Helm's Hold]], the Old Dirty Dwarf caters mostly to newcomers to the city. ln the wake of the [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Protector's]] occupation of [[Neverwinter]] and his increasing presence in the Hold, Mintarn mercenaries have come to dominate the inn's patronage, often with new exiles from [[Neverwinter]] in tow.

Juetta, a human female of about thirty years, runs an establishment that is safe, if none too clean. The Old Dirty Dwarf welcomes all, but some of the staff makes an exclusion for spellscarred, actively discouraging their business. Juetta frowns on this sort of behaviour, but she can't be everywhere in the place at the same time, so she can't stop the growing tensions that bubble over in the tavern from time to time.

Due to the inn's reputation as the place for fresh arrivals, several former patients of the asylum — cloaked foulspawn that can pass for human — keep watch over the Old Dirty Dwarf at all times. They report to [[Rohini|The Prophet]] on particularly interesting newcomers (such as the characters).
