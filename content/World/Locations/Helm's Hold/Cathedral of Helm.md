A towering and inspiring edifice of pale grey stone that's visible for miles around. As much a fortress as a temple, the cathedral contains an orphanage, a hospital, an asylum, and training grounds for [[Order of the Gilded Eye]] initiates. Holy Watcher [[Alisara Callum]] (LG female Tethyrian human priest of Helm), who presides over the cathedral, is determined to root out corruption wherever she finds it. Few doubt that her words carry the weight of [[Helm]]'s divine wisdom.

# Halls of the Guardian
The daylight floors of the temple look much as they did a hundred years ago: hung with banners of [[Helm]]'s sigil and warded at all corners by suits of armour that feature stylized eyes on their gauntlets and prominent, blank faced helms. Cavernous chambers soar high through flying buttresses, and great statues of [[Helm]] and heroes of legend gaze down upon supplicants.

The walls block most sound, but sometimes a cry or an incoherent rant reverberates up from the deeper levels of the complex. The effect is a sharp contrast in what otherwise appears to be a glorious temple.

The great hall of the cathedral could accommodate a hundred men-at-arms comfortably, though today it has a far different purpose. It is here that [[Rohini|The Prophet]] sits in audience, dispensing her predictions of future events. If asked to do so, she might lay her hands on those in attendance and tell their fortunes.

Beneath the cathedral lies a Sanatorium.

# Sanatorium
Beneath the stately, well-lit halls on the surface, the lower levels of the cathedral grow darker and more frightening. A sanatorium hides in the vaults: a maze of cramped corridors that houses a growing number of spellscarred victims, who struggle with insanity or physical deformities.

Once a day, the patients are allowed out onto the cathedral grounds, under close observation by priests. Although the madness of these unfortunates unnerves most visitors, [[Rohini|The Prophet]] spends a great deal of time in the sanatorium without being affected. To the folk of [[Helm's Hold]], this is a sign of her compassionate nature. **The truth** — that she spends her time warping and experimenting on the hapless prisoners — would horrify the townspeople.

The warden of the sanatorium is [[Torlgar]], a hulking goliath (Monster Manual 2). An early and easy mark for [[Rohini]]'s charm, [[Torlgar]] is fiercely loyal to his beloved mistress to the point of death (and beyond). In return, she has corrupted him, and patches of his skin are beginning to turn inside out as she continues the process of turning him into a foulspawn berserker (Monster Manual I).

Rohini has created a number of foulspawn, which are secreted among the patients and orderlies, some of them bound in rags like victims of the [[Spellplague]] (which, in a sense, is what they are). These creatures are disguised not only by their garb but also by the other occupants of the sanatorium. Visitors who are not actively looking for foul spawn will see only poor, mad wretches and the spell scarred who serve them.
