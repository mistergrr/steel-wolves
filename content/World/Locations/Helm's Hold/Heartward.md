The central plaza of Helm's Hold as well as the city's open marketplace.

Life and death are both on stage in the plaza called Heartward at the centre of Helm's Hold, where a marketplace is arrayed around a hangman's scaffold. Food and gold are both scarce in the marketplace, and brawls break out between customers who feel cheated. Soldiers keep watch from the perimeter of the plaza. 

On certain nights, when clouds obscure the waning moon, luminous ghosts wander around it, going about the business of the Living. Phantom vendors sell ephemeral apples at empty stands, ghost children play in the streets, and spirits hang one another on the scaffold. Some of the scenes appear to be re-enactments of past events, whereas others have not occurred-at least, not yet. The ghosts speak mostly nonsense, but some of what they say might offer clues to past or future happenings.

The plaza's name comes from a small shrine on the edge of the marketplace devoted to Sune, goddess of beauty and romance, which is a favoured meeting place for lovers in the city. On haunted nights, couples gather at the shrine, hoping for a thrill.
