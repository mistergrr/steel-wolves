Once a bastion of safety on the edge of Neverwinter Wood, the fortified monastery and community called Helm's Hold has endured through the last decades, diminished but unyielding. It has lived through the death of the god who gave the place its name, the ravages of the [[Spellplague]], and the ruination of [[Neverwinter]]. Through all this, Helm's Hold has taken a serious beating but stubbornly clings to its original purpose: to provide sanctuary for those who none.

Helm's Hold has always been a place of healing and protection for the people of Faerum. Even when [[Helm]] perished a year before the [[Spellplague]], the monastery remained open, seeking to aid those with nowhere else to turn. During the decades after the [[Spellplague]] hit, the Hold became one of the few safe destinations — if not the only one — along the Sword Coast. [[The Cataclysm]] once again made clear the need for Helm's Hold and its services. Its doors have remained open over the years, admitting all who suffer, regardless of race, background, or faith.
Today, the monastery proper serves as an asylum for those cursed with the [[Spellplague]]. People from all over Faerun make the pilgrimage here for treatment, as do people from [[Neverwinter]], which is less than a day's journey to the northwest. In fact, [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] issued a standing order a year ago that anyone in the city showing symptoms of [[Spellplague]] infection should be sent to Helm's Hold as soon as possible. The influx of the needy since that time has swelled the town's numbers, but tolerance is in the air here, so the spellscarred feel more at home in the Hold than anywhere else in the Realms.

Originally a small monastery and its surrounding village, Helm's Hold has grown over the decades. The cathedral's foundation had hardly been laid when [[Helm]] died, but the people finished it as a monument in his honour. [[Helm]] has become a cultural icon here — a patron saint of the community — and all followers of all gods are welcome under his watchful gaze.

Because Helm's Hold is so open and receptive, it is vulnerable to roving monsters and the plots of dark forces in the area. In particular, a pack of werewolves operating at the beck and call of the Netherese has targeted the community, and especially the cathedral, for infiltration and conquest.

From beneath the shadowy boughs of [[Neverwinter Wood]]. Uthgardt barbarians calling themselves the [[Gray Wolves]] stalk Helm's Hold. disguised as human pilgrims by day and showing their lycanthropic nature by night. On the direct orders of the [[Netherese]], they kidnap citizens. murder prominent defenders of the town., and seek to subvert the Hold's leadership. Netheril briefly controlled the place before the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]], but in the chaos of that time. the Netherese let their grasp slip.

By day, the streets of the town are crowded with people going about their business as worn blue pennants hang from buildings, flapping in the breeze. These banners — depicting the gauntlet-and-eye sigil of Helm, the dead god of guardians — adorn the buildings not as a sign of religious faith, but as a cultural tradition. Some residents of the Hold claim that, despite his death, Helm still watches all deeds done in the city, and his dispassionate eye judges all.

Helm's Hold has undergone new construction in the last year to keep up with the rising population of spellscarred, concerned families, and other refugees. The town is a hodgepodge of original structures and newer buildings stuffed between or atop them. At present, the city suffers from a lack of skilled laborers; most of its carpenters and stonemasons went to [[Neverwinter]], answering [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]]'s call — and coin — to rebuild there. The result is a town that seems too large for its resources. Many buildings lie in disrepair with no one to fix them, whole tenements stand deserted or infested with monsters, and rotted wood, heaps of broken stone, and rusty nails are common place street hazards.

The settlement enjoys prosperity today, but such benefit was hard-won and requires vigilance to retain. Helm's Hold is vulnerable on many fronts, in large part because of its proximity to Neverwinter Wood — which, if anything, has become more dangerous in recent times. Rumors of maddened treants abound, as well as stories of Uthgardt barbarians once again raiding the trails that lead to the hold.

Dominating the skyline of the hold is the great edifice: the [[Cathedral of Helm]]. As much a fortification as it is a temple, the cathedral has a small building on its grounds that serves as an orphanage, wards for caring for the sick and injured, as well as a newer addition that houses the mad and deformed who have been brought up from the catacombs.

# Heartward
Within the walls of Helm's Hold are numerous residences surrounding a central district called the [[Heartward]], wherein the characters can find a roomy tavern (called the [[Old Dirty Dwarf]]), several quiet hostels, and a bustling marketplace with sturdy stone-and-timber embankment walls all the way around. There's a recently constructed temple to Lady Firehair, called the Heartward Hall.

A wooden hangman's scaffold stands in the centre of the marketplace, and on certain nights, when clouds obscure the waning moon, luminous ghosts wander around it, going about the business of the Living. Phantom vendors sell ephemeral apples at empty stands, ghost children play in the streets, and spirits hang one another on the scaffold. Some of the scenes appear to be re-enactments of past events, whereas others have not occurred-at least, not yet. The ghosts speak mostly nonsense, but some of what they say might offer clues to past or future happenings.

# Scar Alley
During the Spellplague, the ground upon which the Hold is built softened, causing some buildings to bow or lean precariously out over the streets. Much of the original stone construction of Scar Alley is approaching ruin, and the residents do what they can to bolster the failing structures with planks, mortar, and fresh stone. The district is poorly patrolled, full of hovels that are frequented by shady characters or infested by monsters.

## Encounters
goblins
gnolls
ghouls
[[Gray Wolves]] werewolves

# The Warrens
For years, the residents of Scar Alley have occasionally reported seeing flitting shadows in the streets and at windows, as though small, fast creatures were watching their most intimate moments. Some people have come to the conclusion that the district is haunted by fey spirits. However, the the explanation is more mundane. Humans and their ilk are not the only ones altered by the Spellplague; a number of spell scarred goblins, kobolds, and other light-footed
humanoid monsters dwell in a subterranean complex beneath Scar Alley called the Warrens.

When Helm's Hold first began to expand as a city, engineers started to excavate a drainage system for the monastery and the surrounding town. When the engineers broke into the cathedral's original crypts, however, monsters overwhelmed the delvers and drove them out. Ultimately, the city abandoned the half-completed project. These passages have since become a haven for monstrous humanoids of all sorts.

Deep tunnels connect the crypts to [[The Chasm]] in Neverwinter, allowing the aboleths' servants to slink to and from Helm's Hold as needed. The [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] has claimed the crypts for its own fell purposes. These tunnels also contain a concealed teleportation circle that connects the crypts to the underground chamber that holds the [[Hex Locus]].

In days long past, Helm's servants rested peacefully in the Crypts of the Vigilant Eye, but since the death of their god, they have stirred frequently. Generally powerless, they nevertheless rise to confront intruders not sworn to [[Helm]], and after years of dealing with the "mad ones" (foulspawn), they are likely to welcome the characters as potential saviours. The servants cannot aid in combat, but they can give the characters the benefit of their knowledge about the foulspawn and the nature of the crypts.

## Encounters
Foulspawn stand guard here, as do a variety of undead creatures animated and twisted by Spellplague energy (particularly plaguechanged ghouls)

# Governance
Helm's Hold is a dangerous place, as evidenced by the linen-wrapped bodies left each morning near doorsteps and in the mouths of alleys. Laws are looser in this frontier town that relies on cooperation and self. sufficiency, but recent attacks and tensions among the newly arrived spellscarred necessitate armed patrols.

[[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] has lent the services of some of his mercenaries to serve as a town watch, captained by an old associate of [[Dagult Neverember|Neverember]] named [[Captain Dunfield|Dunfield]] . He drew this assignment after getting into a disagreement with the Protector. Hard-bitten and cynical, [[Captain Dunfield|Dunfield]] remains an honorable man who tries to keep his soldiers in line and serve the community as best as he can.

The government consists of a council of elected speakers who meet in a former inn called the [[Dragon's Gauntlet]] to discuss and debate laws. Although they have little say over the Mintarn soldiers, the speakers happily accept the extra protection — at least for the time being. If [[Dagult Neverember|Neverember]] overstays his welcome or overreaches, the Hold's independent nature is sure to assert itself. By that time, however, it might be too late. [[Dagult Neverember|Neverember]] already has enough clout in town to do away with the council and establish martial law ifhe sees fit.

The battered town hall of Helm's Hold, formerly an inn called the [[Dragon's Gauntlet]], is a popular gathering place for the people of the city, as well as a forum for its tempestuous governmental process. The people of the town are rugged individualists at heart, a characteristic that does not always mesh well with governmental edicts. Loud shouts, challenges, and shows of intimidation are acceptable methods of discussing legislation.

Everyone in Helm's Hold pays deference to [[Alisara Callum]], the town's elected Chief Speaker. Her ability to inspire loyalty helps to keep the haphazard government functioning. A former soldier now past her prime, [[Alisara Callum|Alisara]] brings a note of legitimacy to the council. [[Alisara Callum|Alisara]] is well liked, though her policies of accepting the spellscarred irk some in the city. In particular, councilman [[Doloran Bard]], an aging farmer whose family long ago helped build the original monastery, is wary of trusting the direction of Helm's Hold to an outsider. An unrepentant purist when it comes to the spellscarred, Bard would prefer that the town push out the "unclean" hordes and return the Hold to its original purpose.

# Encounters
Spellscarred characters in Helm's Hold initially find the town blissfully free of open mistrust and intolerance. A spellscarred character might feel more comfortable here than anywhere else,  whereas other adventurers might find the many scarred people in Helm's Hold bewildering or at least unusual.

The growing movement against the spellscarred can provide interesting story hooks. For example, the son or daughter of a worker who perished from the disease might target other spellscarred for vengeance. Characters who venture out after dark might be attacked by roving "pureblood" gangs that want to purge Helm's Hold of the Spellplague. A spell scarred character might be recruited by the Heirs of Azure- and marked as an enemy if the offer is rejected.

Perhaps a drive is launched to push nonhuman spell scarred out of the city, or a popular political figure challenges [[Alisara Callum]] with an anti-spellscarred agenda. An interesting twist might be for [[Doloran Bard]] (or another resident who vociferously opposes the spellscarred) to have a  spellscarred child or other relative who pleads with the characters for help in convincing Bard to cool his incendiary rhetoric.

Helm's Hold occasionally comes under attack from marauding monsters. Conflicts with goblins or gnolls in the outlying farms might inspire the characters to help protect the peasants, or [[Alisara Callum|Alisara]] might hire their aid. Perhaps a squadron of Many-Arrows ores pushes everyone back into Helm's Hold, prompting the adventurers to help defend the city or risk an escape through the crypts beneath the cathedral. The party might be asked to join the Mintarn mercenaries in fighting the [[Gray Wolves]] lycanthropes or support the guards on a mission that is too dangerous for
them to handle alone.

Peril could come from within as well. Farm production can barely keep up with the increasing population, and a bad harvest would mean disaster for the town. The characters might track down an evil druid or monster that is ruining the crops or poisoning the wells. In another possibility, a plague of a different sort might break out and force [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] to quarantine Helm's Hold, creating a dangerous island of intrigues, rivalries, and violence that the characters must navigate.
