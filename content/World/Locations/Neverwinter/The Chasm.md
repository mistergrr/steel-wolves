The southeastern quarter of Neverwinter lies in almost complete ruin, virtually flattened by the earthquake during [[The Cataclysm]] and since then under continual assault by forces of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. At the centre of this wasteland yawns **the Chasm** a canyonlike crack in the earth that spawns all manner of twisted and deadly beasts. It extends down into the Underdark to a subterranean lake that is part of the domain of the [[Aboleth]]s. At the bottom of this sea churns an active pocket of [[Spellplague]].

Proximity to the Chasm causes mild anxiety, moodiness, and paranoia. The effects are obvious on people at [[The Wall]], and they increase in intensity as one moves closer to — or deeper into — the Chasm.

It becomes difficult to think clearly, and even allies seem to hold treachery in their hearts. Recently, this pervasive ill will has begun to radiate beyond the confines of the Wall, plaguing the dreams of Neverwinter's residents with terrible nightmares.

The surrounding land in the district that takes its name from the Chasm is a tangled maze of broken buildings and clotted streets, all of it battered by the elements and crushed under the paws of the Chasm's monsters. Wall patrols venture into this wasteland only occasionally, since few who leave the barricades safety return. Those who do sometimes carry marks from the experience, such as azure burns, twisted limbs, or some other physical manifestation of a
spell scar. [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] has ordered that anyone showing symptoms of infection should be sent to [[Helm's Hold]] for treatment.

The Chasm is unfortified but not without defenses. Characters who reach the edge face attacks by a coven of [[Plaguechanged]] harpies (Monster Manual) that perch in the shattered hulks of buildings nearby. Their purpose is to battle intruders and to fly down into the Chasm to warn the more formidable monsters below of trespassers. Unless the characters can slay every [[Harpy]] near them before the creatures deliver the warning, they might climb down into a series of ambushes.
