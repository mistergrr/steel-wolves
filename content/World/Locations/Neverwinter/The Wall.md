A great hodgepodge of wood and scavenged stone, the Wall separates civilized Neverwinter from [[The Chasm]] and the horrors it spawns. The Wall lets guards strike at targets from positions of relative safety, and it provides regular outposts for watchers. The thick mess of a bloodstained refuse at the eastern base — not to mention the occasional rotting corpse of a more recent kill — speaks to the Wall 's success as a defensive fortification.

The Wall was built shortly after the cataclysm, when the city's few remaining residents realized they needed a defense against the twisted monsters that spilled from [[the Chasm]]. They cobbled together a barricade from whatever they could find: collapsed buildings, broken carts, wrecked ships, and the like. The ruined Jewel of the North provided no shortage of raw materials.

In its early days, the Wall held off the monsters by shunting them toward parts of the city that had already been destroyed. When [[Dagult Neverember|Neverember]] arrived, he made it a priority to reinforce what he saw as an effective defensive fortification with his own engineers and soldiers.

At first, the Wall blocked only a few streets where attacks were common, but since the reconstruction started, it has expanded to stretch from the [[Neverdeath]]
graveyard to the old [[The House of Knowledge|House of Knowledge]].

In combination with the Neverwinter River, the Wall continues to provide effective containment,
although people have spotted plaguechanged monstrosities in the northern River District and, more recently, near sewer holes around the city. The situation grows dire, and petitions for Wall expansion come before [[Mayor Soman Galt|Mayor Galt]] every day.
