# History
The Leviathan was an infamous pirate vessel that prowled up and down the Sword Coast, striking terror into those that crossed its path. The Leviathan’s captain, [[Captain Harrag|Harrag]], was a fearsome foe to any that met him at sea, and no sailors felt their treasure safe while [[Captain Harrag]] was out hunting on the [[Sea of Swords]]. Sometime after the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]], the Leviathan ran aground in northern [[Neverwinter History]] and punctured its hull. Rather than abandon his ship, [[Captain Harrag|Harrag]] stayed with it as the city’s docks were rebuilt around the ship (part of the general reconstruction efforts of the time). [[Captain Harrag|Harrag]] oversaw the ship’s conversion from a wreck into a thriving inn and tavern.
