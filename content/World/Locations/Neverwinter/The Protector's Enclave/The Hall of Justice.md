The Hall of Justice stood as the primary temple to [[Tyr]], the god of law and justice, in the city of Neverwinter. The Hall’s grand stone walls, towering stone pillars, and high domed roof make it an impressive and intimidating structure. Its interior is also large enough to house large races such as giants and dragons.

Serving as much more than a mere temple to a deity, the Hall of Justice functioned as the city’s court for low justice (i.e., excluding crimes where the accused were of noble birth, lacking citizenship, or charged with murder). It also served as a drilling and training ground in disciplined weaponry for those devout followers who served to defend the temple and that for which it stood. The Hall’s functions largely ceased with Tyr’s death in the late 1300s DR.

When Tyr gave up his divinity to [[Torm]], the residents of Neverwinter refused to rededicate the temple, and so the Tyrran faith remained strong in Neverwinter even after the death of the god himself.

When [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] arrived in the city in [[Neverwinter History#^1468|1468 DR]] , he installed a temporary priesthood of [[Torm]] at the location, reasoning there were similarities in religious tenets. He also used the temple as a base for his operations in the city as well as a personal residence. Both actions were met with disapproval by the city’s residents.

After Dagult Neverember installed himself in the Hall of Justice, his detractors, specially the [[The Nashers]]), began to call the temple "the Hall of Never-Justice".
