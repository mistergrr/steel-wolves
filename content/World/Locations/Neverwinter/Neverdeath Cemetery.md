**Location**: The Chasm District, [[Neverwinter History]]
* Neverwinter's graveyard.
* Two major sections.
* ***The Pauperâ€™s section
	* To the southwest. 
	* Contains rows upon rows of humble graves.
* ***The other section
	* Contains more elaborate mausoleums where nobility and wealthy were laid to rest.
* The corpses now spring back to life and attack visitors.
* Tall walls protect the horrors of the graveyard from attacking the city.
* The people of Neverwinter now burn their dead.

The graveyard takes its name from a common blessing given over the dead. As long as the city remained in summer, it was said, the dead would never truly leave. Many think that winter is coming soon for the city's dead, however, brought by malevolent forces from [[Thay]]. Neverember's mercenaries fear the graveyard, preferring to burn the dead outside the walls of the burial ground. If they are not burned, corpses left lying nearby sometimes rise of their own accord.
