One of the most enchanting features of the city of Neverwinter is its three large floating earthmotes. The Spellplague of 1385 DR caused chunks of  Neverwinter (as well as other areas all over Toril) to rise up and begin floating away. Industrious residents of Neverwinter were able to tether a few of these earthmotes with ropes and prevent them from ultimately flying off into the Sword Coast.
