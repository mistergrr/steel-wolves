This region of Neverwinter stands largely intact in the the wake of the cataclysm. Credit for the survival of the Blacklake District goes mostly to the nobles of Neverwinter who dwelt here and constructed their homes with extra support, both material and magical. Many of these nobles died in the fire that swept the area after the cataclysm, but their houses remain.

The district holds a large number of overgrown estates, scores of stout, defensible hold fasts, and a
large park that contains the lake for which the region is named. The water was polluted by a great deal of ash and rubbish in the quake, and today Blacklake looks more like a midden pit of sludge than a lake.

Some locals are making an effort to dredge it and restore the surrounding environs.
After securing the Protector's Enclave, Lord Neverember's mercenaries have turned more of
their attention to Blacklake as the next district for resettlement, but their efforts have not been fruitful.

Numerous secret societies aggressively resist their efforts to pacify the neighbourhood. Blacklake harbors a great deal of old blood and nationalism, which takes the form of opposition to the Lord Protector. Muggers and hot-tempered duellists plague the streets of Blacklake, and political agitators hold small rallies or foment subtle conspiracies against the powers that be. The [[Sons of Alagondar]] set ambushes for [[Mintarn]] enforcers and wage pitched battles in the streets.

Lord Neverember loathes the slow, frustrating process of trying to civilize this district so it can be resettled by Neverwinter refugees. It is a job that requires near constant attention, compared to the relative ease with which the Protector's Enclave was tamed.

In particular, the [[Ashmadai cultists]] of Asmodeus infiltrate the ranks of the mercenaries and refugees alike. A few blocks from the Protector's beachhead at the southern end of the district, the cultists leave graffiti of their devil god on the crumbling buildings.

# Future 1485 DR
The Bluelake District, formerly the “Blacklake District”, was home to many of the noble estates in Neverwinter. Most of the estates fared well against the cataclysm thanks to their sturdy construction. However, many were left abandoned after their owners perished in the cataclysm. The abandoned buildings proved fertile ground for the seedy underbelly ofthe city to gain a foothold.

Lord Neverember and his mercenaries saw great opportunity in resettling the overgrown estates in the district. However, when they attempted to do so, they found themselves attacked by a variety of factions. Seemingly every shadow faction of the city, from the [[Sons of Alagondar]] to the [[Dead Rats]], had taken up residence in the area. It became extremely dangerous to traverse this section of the city. In recent years, however, it has improved dramatically.

## Bluelake
Bluelake, formerly called “Blacklake”, is a lake that sits in the center of its namesake district. The lake is used for boating activities at times. However, in the summer, the lake’s level decreases dramatically and becomes somewhat more of a swamp.

The lake became particularly vile and sludge-filled after the eruption of [[Mount Hotenow]], which filled the lake with ash. [[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] made dredging and restoring the lake one of his priorities. This effort seems to have been successful, and it was renamed “Bluelake”.
