Those who seek to expand their influence and power throughout Faer√ªn are often drawn to the Zhentarim. The Zhentarim follows its own rules, regardless of whether or not they align with the law of the land. They are not opposed to shady deals and illicit activities to get what they want. Merchants, noble families, and city councils may hire the Zhentarim to help with their problems, provided that they can afford the price. Despite their loose morality, they are not necessarily evil, as they know that business cannot thrive if chaos reigns.
