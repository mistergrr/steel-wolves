A clandestine network of spellcasters and spies who seek to tip the scales in favour of the innocent, weak, and poor within the realms. Their agents are incorruptible defenders of good, never hesitating to aid the oppressed. They usually work alone, behind the scenes, relying on their wits and extensive information networks. Harpers seek out powerful items, not for their own use, but to keep them away from evildoers. Whilst agents often work alone, their kinship is unbreakable, and they will always be willing to support another Harper.

Members are given the title, [[Watcher]]
