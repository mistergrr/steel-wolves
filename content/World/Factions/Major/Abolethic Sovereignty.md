This kingdom of aberrant creatures was transplanted from Abeir, Toril's twin world. The aboleths settled in and forged Xxiphu, a flying citadel that roams the world and is most often spotted in the Sea of Fallen Stars.

The Sovereignty quickly took an interest in the [[Spellplague]], which had brought its kingdom to Faerûn. It began locating and studying areas of active [[Spellplague]] caught within magical fields or trapped in the earth's depths. The aboleths found one such patch in [[Underdark]], far beneath [[Neverwinter]], and a branch of the Sovereignty took up residence there several decades ago. The aboleths have been using it — and creatures kidnapped from the city — for their ambitious experiments.

When [[The Cataclysm]] claimed Neverwinter and opened [[The Chasm]], the aboleths' operations were in danger of being exposed to the surface world. Since moving the patch of [[Spellplague]] was not an option, the Sovereignty instead bolstered its defenses and sent the results of its early experiments toward the surface to repel or discourage any would-be explorers. The city above had already fallen into chaos, so no resistance was mounted. The aboleths rested contentedly for years thereafter.

Then, in [[Neverwinter History#^1468|1468 DR]], [[Dagult Neverember|Neverember]] arrived in the city. The resulting flurry of activity drew the Sovereignty's attention, and the aboleths came to see Neverwinter's reconstruction and resettling as a threat to their larger plans.

# Goals
The aboleths have been at work in [[Neverwinter History]] for decades, and they aren't about to let the city's reconstruction hamper their efforts. To them, the returning refugees represent a greater body of potential subjects to choose from.

## Expand the Choir
The Sovereignty is collecting [[Plaguechanged]] creatures to join the choir of its [[Symphony of Madness]]. Selected members act as conduits for the captured [[Spellplague]]'s energy. So far, the aboleths have used the fledgling choir to douse captured monsters and kidnapped people in the corruptive magic, twisting the creatures into foulspawn servants.

The Sovereignty tests the mettle of captives before inserting them into the choir. If a candidate's body and mind survive exposure to the [[Spellplague]], the victim is a potential match. But a creature rendered insane by the process isn't up to snuff and is recycled as a roving monster set loose through the Chasm. These latter victims are in some ways the lucky ones. Potential candidates are subjected to a series of increasingly traumatic tests to determine their aptitude for singing in the choir. After such experimentation, little is left to identify a singer as humanoid or even natural anymore.

## Harness the Primordial
As important as conquest and bolstering their forces are to the aboleths, their primary goal is far more ambitious. Even the Symphony of Madness is a cog working toward the Sovereignty's ultimate aim: seizing [[Maegera]], the fiery primordial bound in lost [[Gauntlgrym]].

Soon after its kingdom arrived in Toril, the Sovereignty sensed the slumbering primordial, and that realization awoke in the aboleths all manner of dastardly schemes. Using their Choir, the creatures
enslaved the mind flayers of the ancient dungeon and set them to learning about this potentially infinite power source. They plan to use the [[Spellplague]] to harness [[Maegera]], dominating its mind — or whatever guiding force a primordial has — and possibly plaguechanging it.

A world-shattering force under the control of the Abolethic Sovereignty — one that frightens even gods — would spell disaster for Faerûn and everyone in it.

# Symphony of Madness
The Symphony of Madness releases nightmares that damage more than a sufferer's sleep. What those effects are and who endures them are up to you.

Those most affected could become spellscarred or [[plaguechanged]] and be banished to [[Helm's Hold]]. Maybe the night visions inspire violent madness or cause lingering status effects in victims. Perhaps hallucinations seize the heroes and drain their healing surges. Maybe the nightmares provoke attack penalties during extended rests. Or the dreams could provide hints to guide players in the direction you want them to go.

Generally, use the Symphony as a tool to drive your campaign and create a sense of unease.

# Encounters
The aboleths can twist nearly any creature — humanoid, beast, or monster — that enters the region. For covert operations, they can use the [[Symphony of Madness]] to alter humanoids in subtle ways, making them aberrant and subservient to the Sovereignty without arousing suspicions in people around them. Such victims make excellent spies and sacrificial pawns.

Some of the aboleths' servitors are more obvious: foul spawn, gricks, grell, and nothics. Culled from
the Underdark or created from weaker vessels, these monsters serve as soldiers and shock troops, guarding [[The Chasm]] and keeping topside creatures from delving inside.
