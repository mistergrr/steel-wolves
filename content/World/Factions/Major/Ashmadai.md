Devil worshipers sworn to [[Asmodeus]]. Led by [[Mordai Veil]]

# Goals
As befits servants of Asmodeus, the supreme master of the Nine Hells, Ashmadai cultists seek to control Neverwinter, either as daylight rulers or covertly through intimidation and black mail. 

Cultists assign [[Imp]]s, [[Bearded Devil]]s, Spined Devils, and others to bring chaos, devastation, and despair to their foes and people they just don't like. Rituals to summon these fiends involve extensive bloodletting. Every time the Ashmadai summons a devil, it must also bind a mortal creature to the essence of a devil. Thus, Ashmadai thugs regularly kidnap residents of Neverwinter in order to make them vessels.

# Operations
Lacking the numbers and individual power to flout Lord Neverember's thugs, the cult cannot yet operate openly in the city. Therefore, [[Mordai Veil]] uses a pod system to manage his sect and shroud it from prying eyes. The highest-ranking members report separately to [[Mordai Veil|Mordai]] and do not know each other. Each of those leaders has his or her own pod whose cultists report separately to that individual - and so on down through the ranks. Each higher-ranking member regularly assigns tasks to inferior cultists without disclosing the larger scheme. Many of these tasks involve recruiting young nobles and merchant scions who are easily swayed by promises of power, wealth, or influence.

[[Mordai Veil|Mordai]] readily encourages his followers to mark buildings and corpses with the symbol of [[Asmodeus]]. This was to intimidate others into joining the ranks of the Ashmadai. The symbol was effective as it managed to scare the townsfolk into co-operating with their demands. Although Favria disagrees with the plan, she does not deny it's effectiveness.
