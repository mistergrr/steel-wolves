# Description
The Crown of Neverwinter was a warrior king's crown made out of mithral inlaid with four blue sapphires.

# Powers
The Crown of Neverwinter had the property to protect its wearer from extreme temperatures of cold and heat, and could magically enhance the majesty of the wearer, giving its wearer an advantage when talking with or intimidating someone. The Crown could also emit a burst of cold and heat to damage the wearer's enemies.

It said to kill any pretender to the crown. That is, only those of the Alagondar bloodline could wear the Crown of Neverwinter. If someone who wasn't a descendant of [[King Nasher Alagondar|Nasher Alagondar]] donned the Crown, the individual would be destroyed by a burst of cold and heat.

# History
During [[King Nasher Alagondar|Nasher Alagondar]]'s reign, Neverwinter became concerned about losing the Crown after Nasher was injured in a battle at Highcliff. Thus, the city commissioned the creation of a magic puzzle box from a Red Wizard that would be able to retrieve the Crown if it was ever lost or stolen. If the box's puzzle was solved, it summoned an emerald golem—which appeared as a tall woman wearing a vest and trousers—who could then be commanded to teleport to the exact location of the Crown, retrieve it, and return with it. The Red Wizard conspired to use the box to steal the Crown for himself, but was thwarted and killed. Unfortunately, he had hidden the box by this point, and its location remained unknown.

The Crown of Neverwinter was lost during [[The Cataclysm]] of 1451 DR. Some believed the Crown was hidden in a secret vault in Castle Never, but only the ghosts that haunted the place knew for sure.

In the Year of the Dark Circle, 1478 DR, the [[Sons of Alagondar]] discovered that a collector named Karion had come into possession of the box which could summon the Crown from wherever it was located.Rucas Sarfael, Elyne Tschavarz, and Montimort used the box to obtain the Crown, but the Crown was then stolen by Lord Protector Dagult Neverember's spymaster, Dhafiyand, who revealed that his true master was Valindra Shadowmantle of Thay. Following a failed assassination attempt on Neverember, Dhafiyand was slain and Neverember gained possession of the the Crown. Meanwhile, the box was destroyed, but its emerald golem was recovered by Valindra Shadowmantle, who was able to learn of the Crown's location from the construct.

The real Crown of Neverwinter was stored in the vaults beneath the Hall of Justice. Although Neverember had the Crown at his disposal, he didn't wear it, something polemical among the different factions of the city.
