The **Symphony of Madness** is a song ritual created by the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] to control the primordial [[Maegera the Inferno]] and harness its powers.

The Symphony was created by the Choir, a group of [[plaguechanged]] creatures that sang a telepathic tune that could be heard at any point between [[Neverwinter]], [[Helm's Hold]], and [[Gauntlgrym]]. The song was powered by the [[Spellplague]] energies the aboleths harnessed from the [[Cauldron of Blue Fire]]. Therefore, those creatures chosen to be part of the Choir were subjected to a series of increasingly traumatic tests to determine their aptitude to "sing" in the Choir, and eventually were warped by the [[Spellplague]] energies into something unrecognizable.

The song of the Choir was, in essence, a beam of focused [[Spellplague]] energy that could twist stone or flesh depending on subtle variations in the Choir's harmony, warping reality in ways that made sense only to an aberrant mind. By using the [[Hex Locus]], the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] could enhance the Symphony's range, to reach places far away from the normal range of the Symphony.

Those who "heard" the Symphony would suffer horrible nightmares. The only way to avoid having nightmares within the Symphony's range was to sleep near a [[dreamthief doll]]. Excessive exposure to the Symphony could turn creatures into [[spellscarred]] or even into [[plaguechanged]] beings. If focused against a creature or group of creatures, the Symphony could corrupt and twist the mind of the targets, turning them into thralls of the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]], puppets whose only purpose was to serve their masters to the best of their abilities, or even turn the most unfortunate targets into foulspawn if the corruption went too far.
