## Description
The dragon's elf form dates to when [[Rohini|The Prophet]] first bound him to service. She had her [[foulspawn]] sorcerers destabilize his body so that she could change it to torture him. After Chartilifax caused chaos among pilgrims to [[Helm's Hold]], [[Rohini]] brought him from the forest to the Hold, explaining that he was originally an elf whose spellscar allowed him to take the form of a dragon. Thus, she gained a new ally while enhancing her loving, compassionate reputation. To this day, the dragon finds the green elf the most comfortable form to wear.

Charismatic characters might convince the dragon to speak with them for a time. Chartilifax has lost his grip on sanity and makes observations that seem to be nonsense but that contain kernels of truth, such as "The sun is blooming, but the lady hides behind her other face" (referring to [[Rohini|The Prophet]]) or "The ones in the depths are the ones with the eyes that see" (referring to the [[Abolethic Sovereignty"aboleths]] beneath [[Neverwinter]]).

The dragon is particularly interested in magic, hoarding spells the way others of his kind hoard coins. He consumes fire magic like a rare delicacy, delighting in the taste of fresh flames. Chartilifax also has a hoard of his own, built out of the possessions of foes he has eaten.
