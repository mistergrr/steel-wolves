creature: Aboleth
```

The aboleths have been experimenting for years to produce better and deadlier fighting machines, subjecting whatever monsters they can capture to the Spellplague to augment the creatures. Their breeding program has no rhyme or reason that humanoids can comprehend—it makes sense only to an aberrant mind. The end results include natural animals merged with one another, humanoids twisted into horrifying caricatures of themselves, and any number of monsters granted strange new abilities through spellscars.

>Use the plaguechanged template and sample creatures in Chapter 3 for inspiration when making new monsters to populate this area. If you want to use plaguechanged monsters as story elements rather than game elements, the only difference between a plaguechanged creature and a normal monster of the same sort might lie in the way you describe the beast. For example, give it an odd deformity or a persistent blue glow. Let your imagination run rampant — the Spellplague can twist and change anything in any way.
