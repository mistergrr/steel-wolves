The Spellplague distorts everything it encounters — stone, flesh, spirit. Infested creatures are known as plaguechanged. Every creature is affected differently — some blaze with blue fire when angered, some might have blue scars snaking across its body. The link is the [[Spellplague]]'s signature blue flame.
