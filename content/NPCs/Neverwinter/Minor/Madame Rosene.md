>Characters who interact with [[The Graycloaks]] inevitably come to [[the Driftwood Tavern]]. Madame Rosene is slow to trust outsiders, placing her faith mainly in familiar citizens of old Neverwinter or their children. The characters might earn her respect by recognizing elements of buildings they have seen in the ruins, or bringing her particularly beautiful pieces they recover on their escapades in the city. Madame Rosene might test the adventurers' patience and fortitude by repeatedly sending them in search of specific cultural relics, then deciding that what they bring back is not what she asked for.
