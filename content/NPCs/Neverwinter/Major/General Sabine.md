**Age**: 32
**Voice**: 

**Description**: 
Rather tall and well-built, even for a soldier. Her dark hair frames a scarred face that seldom, if ever, held a smile. She was fittingly described as being "tough-as-nails."

Sabine is a military leader through-and-through. She exhibits the confidence, discipline, and tactical acumen befitting a woman of her rank and accomplishment. She is wholly loyal to the city of Neverwinter.

She does not suffer fools or take the emotional considerations of others into much account. As a result, she often attracted the dislike of others. While she is highly efficient in her duties as a commander, she often demonstrates over-confidence that could be interpreted as weakness.

**Involvement**:
She hired mercenary company, [[The Steel Wolves]], as a supplementary force in her military.
