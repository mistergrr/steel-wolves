**Description**: 
Takes the guise of an attractive human.

Although Rohini does not sit in overt leadership in the cathedral; the acolytes, servants, and patients bow to her, calling her simply "Prophet." She seems to her followers to be a kindly matron of forty years of age, graceful and overwhelmingly compassionate. Through subtle charm, Rohini has captured the hearts and minds of the people — sometimes literally.

The Prophet worships no particular god, but [[Satarin|Brother Satarin]] and the other acolytes believe that several of her auguries foretell the return of [[Helm]], god of guardians. Rohini is accorded a position of comfort, respect, and awe at the cathedral. It also doesn't hurt that she has enthralled several members of the clergy with her succubus powers.

Her laughter is infectious, and her presence sets people at ease. She is easy to trust, and people reveal their deepest secrets and fears to her. But Rohini is a far different being from what she seems to be.

She first existed as a [[Succubus]] in service to the devil lords of the Nine Hells. A consummate seductress known for her prowess at navigating complex intrigues, Rohini was sent to Faerun to infiltrate the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]. Her first assignment was to infiltrate the growing spellscarred treatment centre at the House of Knowledge. When she murdered the center's head researcher, Brother Anthus, she quickly drew the aboleths' attention and interest. A Sovereignty-corrupted priest named Brother Vartan exposed her to the Hex Locus (page 174). This fragment of solidified Spellplague warped her immortal flesh, imbuing her with foulspawn essence.

Now the Prophet's primary purpose is stewardship of the Hex Locus, which she moved to Helm's
Hold to prevent its detection. Secondarily, she collects and tests subjects for the choir, using the Helm's Hold monastery as a base of operations. Of course, the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]] also uses her as a mouthpiece for "prophecies" that can influence others' actions in the region.

Rohini earned her sobriquet through the foretellings she speaks of pivotal events to come, both good and ill. No one in Helm's Hold openly questions her title. The few who are quietly sceptical would prefer to dismiss her as a lunatic, but her pronouncements tend to come true.

In truth, the Sovereignty causes or otherwise anticipates events in such a way that Rohini's prophecies are validated. 
# Quests:
At some point, Rohini might try to steer the characters through reward or charm. She is adept at manipulation and always knows the right thing to say. If one of the characters has a spell scar, the Prophet might claim that she can cure the malady in exchange for a service. Even if the adventurers discover her true nature, she might present herself as an ally rather than an enemy — at least for the time being.

Perhaps Rohini is legitimately on their side, thinking that the characters can free her of the aboleths' influence, or maybe she is setting them up for a fall. Ultimately, she is a devil, and trust and compassion are foreign to her nature. If she does not betray the adventurers immediately, she will try to get rid of them as soon as she wrings every drop of usefulness from them.

Also, for some time, [[Mordai Veil]] — leader of the [[Ashmadai]] cult in [[Neverwinter]] — has actively pursued Rohini in a fervent courtship, one that reached a new level once he learned of her nature as a devil. Since the characters represent a (relatively) neutral third party, Mordai might hire them to learn more about her.

Rohini's loyalties are up to you. She might be the Sovereignty's thrall, or her servitude could be a cover that masks her true identity as a Nine Hells agent.

When the characters first meet her, Rohini presents herself as exactly what she seems: a selfless
humanitarian. She knows how to elicit sympathy, whether it requires healing hurt heroes or arranging for her minions to attack her.

In the scenario presented here, Rohini represents the [[Abolethic Sovereignty]]'s interests in the region, and a campaign against the aboleths might require characters to move against Rohini. But how they decide to engage her will be pivotal. Boneheaded actions could spell disaster for the heroes, the monastery, or the whole of [[Helm's Hold]]. On the other hand, clever and well-planned manoeuvres could seriously set back the Sovereignty's plans and save a whole lot of lives.
