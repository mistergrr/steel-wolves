**Description**: Going a bit mad from running the asylum.

Brother Satarin was an acolyte before Helm's death, and the young dwarf took his vows shortly before the god fell. Satarin stayed at the cathedral, teaching the ways of his fallen master and attending to the needy after the rest of Helm's clergy left the place for other gods or retired from the cloth. Now, at the age of 165, Satarin is as close to a high priest as the cathedral is likely to see again, though he firmly eschews any title but Brother.
