# Mission:
**Objective:** Stop the cultists from completing the ritual to summon a bearded devil.
**Take 2 sidekicks**.
# Location: 
Ashmadai HQ?, Neverwinter.
# Setting the Scene
1. **Entrance Hall:** The players enter from here. The doors are slightly ajar, allowing them to hear the chanting from the main hall.
2. **Main Hall:** The cultists are arranged in a circle around a summoning circle, with the cult fanatic leading the ritual. The imps are hidden in the shadows, invisible, waiting to strike.
3. **Altar:** At the far end of the main hall, there's an altar with infernal symbols. This is where the bearded devil will appear if summoned.
# Enemies:
1. 4 [[Cultist]]: HP 9, AC 12 (CR1/8)
2. 1 [[Cult Fanatic]]: HP 22, AC 13 (CR 2)
3. 2 [[Imp]]: HP 10, AC 13 (CR 1)
4. 1 [[Bearded Devil]]: HP 52, AC 13 (CR 3) (summoned)
# Encounter Flow
## Cultists' Tactics
- **Cultists:** The cultists will engage in melee combat with the players, using their scimitars. If possible, they will try to protect the cult fanatic.
- **Cult Fanatic:** The cult fanatic will use spells like Hold Person and Spiritual Weapon to hinder and damage the players while trying to continue the ritual.
- **Imps:** The imps, starting invisible, will pick off weaker-looking targets or attempt to disrupt spellcasters in the party. They can use their Sting attack and become visible after the first attack.
## Summoning Ritual
- The ritual takes 5 rounds to complete. Each round, the cult fanatic must maintain concentration. If the cult fanatic takes damage, they must make a concentration check (DC 10 or half the damage taken, whichever is higher).
- If the ritual is interrupted (either by breaking the fanatic's concentration or defeating the cultists and fanatic), the bearded devil is not summoned.
- If the ritual is completed, the bearded devil appears at the altar and joins the combat. This significantly increases the difficulty of the encounter.
## Bearded Devil (if summoned)
- **Tactics:** The bearded devil will attack the nearest threat, focusing on characters who deal the most damage or appear to be spellcasters.
# Loot
- **Cultists:** Each cultist carries a scimitar and a small pouch of coins (10-20 GP each).
- **Cult Fanatic:** The cult fanatic has a dark ritual tome (could be a plot device or contain infernal secrets), a potion of healing, and a dagger with infernal engravings (worth 25 GP).
- **Imps:** Imps have no loot, but their presence might hint at greater fiendish threats.
- **Chapel:** The chapel may contain hidden treasures, such as a silver holy symbol (worth 50 GP), and an ancient scroll of protection from fiends (if the party searches thoroughly).
