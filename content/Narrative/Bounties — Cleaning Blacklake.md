# Mission
[[Dagult Neverember|Lord Neverember]] loathes the slow, frustrating process of trying to civilize this district so it can be resettled by Neverwinter refugees. it is a job that requires near-constant attention compared to the relative ease with which the Protector's Enclave was tamed.

Muggers and hot-tempered duellists plague the streets of Blacklake, and political agitators hold small rallies or foment subtle conspiracies against the powers that be. The [[Sons of Alagondar]] set ambushes for [[Mintarn]] enforcers and wage pitched battles in the streets.

In particular, the [[Ashmadai]] cultists of Asmodeus infiltrate the ranks of the mercenaries and refugees alike. A few blocks from the Protector's beachhead at the southern end of the district, the cultists leave graffiti of their devil god on the crumbling buildings.
