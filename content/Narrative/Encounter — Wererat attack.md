# Mission
Rescue the nobleman from the [[Wererat]]
# Location
[[Blacklake District]], Neverwinter.
# Setting the Scene
While walking through Bluelake District, you hear panicked shouting. You see  [[Wererat]] in hybrid form, snarling and brandishing a shortsword, attacking a nobleman and his guard. The guard is slain and the Wererat starts to move on the noble.
# Enemies
1. **Wererat**: HP 33, AC 12 (CR 2)
# Tactics
- The wererat will focus its attacks on the nobles, seeing them as weaker targets.
- If the players intervene, the wererat will attempt to use its nimbleness and keen smell to evade and counter-attack, using its Multiattack to bite and stab.
- The wererat will try to infect one of the players or nobles with its bite if it feels cornered or threatened.
# Rewards
- The wererat carries a crude map marking a hideout in the sewers beneath the Bluelake District.
- The noble turns out to be [[Dagult Neverember]] himself.
	- He appoints the title "[[Protector]]" and sends a letter of commendation to the Steel Wolves.
