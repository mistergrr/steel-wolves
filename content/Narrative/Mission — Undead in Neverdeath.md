# Mission:
[[Dagult Neverember]] is going to [[Neverdeath Cemetery]] to conduct an age-old rite to pay respect to [[King Nasher Alagondar]] (his supposed ancestor) as a publicity event. Protect Lord Neverember as he performs the cultural rite. **Take 2 sidekicks**.
# Location: 
[[Neverdeath Cemetery]], Neverwinter.
# Setting the Scene
Lord Neverember stands at the centre of an ancient circle of gravestones, reciting an age-old rite meant to honour the fallen and keep the spirits at peace. As he speaks, dark forces stir within the cemetery, intent on disrupting the ritual.
# Enemies:
1. **3 [[Shadow]]s**: HP 12, AC 16 (CR 1/2)
2. **2 [[Ghoul]]s**: HP 22, AC 12 (CR 1)
# Encounter Flow
### Initial Phase
- Shadows attack as the party enters the cemetery, drawn to the life energy of the living.
### Mid-Phase
- As Lord Neverember progresses in the ritual, Ghouls rise from the graves to disrupt the rite.
### Final Phase
- As the rite nears completion, the enemies intensify their attacks. The party must balance between protecting Lord Neverember and combating the waves of undead.
