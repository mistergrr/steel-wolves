# Mission
>Villagers who live in the areas outside the city walls have been disappearing around a nearby cave. The cave mouth is covered in spider webs. Villagers have been braving the area to harvest a medicinal plant.

>The Steel Wolves normally wouldn't do this kind of job, but [[Dagult Neverember]] is trying to gain popularity, and a key Neverwintan grew up in the village. Resolving the situation will help Dagult gain their support, and the Steel Wolves will be rewarded well for their help.
>
>Head to the village of [[Whitepetal Hollow]] to investigate. **Take 1 sidekick**.

# Encounter at the cave
## Location: 
A dark, overgrown cave filled with thick webs, hanging vines, and the sounds of fluttering wings. A wooden sword belonging to [[Milnar Oakroot]] lies on the ground outside.
## Enemies:
1. **3 [[Twig Blight]]s**: HP 4 each, AC 13 (CR 1/8 each)
3. **2 [[Giant Bat]]s**: HP 22 each, AC 13 (CR 1/4 each)
4. **1 [[Giant Spider]]**: HP 26, AC 14 (CR 1)

## Tactics:
- The **Twig Blights** lurk among the overgrowth, blending in with the vines and foliage. They wait for an opportune moment to swarm the players, taking advantage of their numbers to overwhelm a single target.
- The **Giant Bats** swoop down from above, using their echolocation to navigate the dark cave. They attempt to harry the players with flyby attacks, making it difficult for the players to retaliate.
- The **Giant Spider** hides in the shadows, using its web to set up ambushes. It targets the players with web attacks to restrain them before closing in for melee combat.
## Environmental Hazards:
- The cave is filled with thick webs that can slow movement. Players may need to make Dexterity saving throws (DC 12) to avoid getting stuck.
- Patches of loose rocks and debris make the ground unstable, requiring players to make Dexterity saving throws (DC 10) to avoid falling prone.
- Areas of the cave are dimly lit or in complete darkness, making visibility an issue for players without darkvision.
## Treasure:
- Hidden in the webs and debris, the players can find a small pouch containing 6 lapis lazuli (10 GP each) and a Potion of Healing.
- Silvered short sword "[[Wolfsbane]]"
- A young boy is wrapped in the spider's web.
